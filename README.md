# Nyan-Game-in-Java
Mini Game called Nyan Cat. This funny graphical user interface has been developed to practice my Java Programming skills and learn new frameworks. 

# Features
The figure of the cat Nyan pops up on the laptop`s monitor and moves over the screen from the right to the left and from the bottom to the top (vice-versa). While it moves, it increases its speed whenever the user clicks on the figure of the cat. When the number of clicks reaches 7, the figure explodes and vanishes.  

# Technologies used
- Java Swing Framework
