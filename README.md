# Nyan-Game-in-Java

Mini Game with Nyan Cat written in Java. The Swing framework is used to create this graphical user interface (GUI) application. It has been developed to practice my Java Programming skills. The figure of Nyan pops up on the laptop`s monitor and increases its speed whenever the user clicks. When the number of clicks reaches 7, the figure vanishes.
